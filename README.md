## Overview

This repository includes implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, along with several coding problems and their solutions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for learning and practicing DSA.

## Data Structures

### Graphs
- Graph representation using adjacency list
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Finding the depth of a node
- Finding the height of a tree

### Trees
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Tree Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
- Depth of a node
- Height of a tree

### Tries
- Trie implementation for string storage and search
- Insertion and search operations

### Heaps
- Binary Heaps
- Heap operations (insertion, deletion, heapify)
- Building a heap from an array

## Algorithms

### Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

### Searching
- Binary Search
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)

### Other
- Stack operations
- Queue operations
