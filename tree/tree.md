= Hierarchial data structure where nodes connected by edges.

= It is a non-linear data structure , but array, linked list, stack ,queue are linear data structures. 

= Linear data structures has time required is proportional to the size of the data set. So for more input data the time complexity will be proportional , but not in the case of tree.

- Because of non-linear nature of tree, it is more quicker and easier to access data.

- Punch point  - ***tree will have no loops or cycles.***

Visualize - many balls connected by lines 


Use cases : File systems (Hierarchial data structure), database( for quick data retrieval),DOM, etc.

Terminologies : Before that have an imaginary picture of the tree. once imagined now start going through the terminologies;
1) Root Node : first node in a tree.
2) Edge : Link that connects one node to another is called Edge.
3) Parent Node (or Internal node) : Has links to child nodes.
4) Node can have one , two or many child nodes. But one node can have only one parent node.
5) Leaf nodes : Have no links to another childs , or say it does not has any childs
6) Height of tree : No.of edges ( root node to leaf node )
7) tree size : no. of nodes in the tree.
8) Sibblings : nodes with same parent.
9) Degree of a node : number of child nodes it has.
10) Degree of a tree : Max degree in the tree.
11) Depth of a node : No of edges from root to that node.
12) Height of a node : No of edges from deepest leaf to that node.
