- Linear data structure, first element added will be the first to be removed.

- Some key operations are enqueue, dequeue, front, size, isEmpty

Use cases : 1) Task handling in printers, 2) that is how operating system works. 3) Request handling in web servers 4) callback queue in javascript runtime 

Key difference between stack and queue :
1) Stack is FIFO and Queue is LIFO.
2) Stack is used when recent added to process first while queue is used when old added to be processed first.\
3) Stack will do at the end and add at the end while queue will add at the end but remove from the start

Enqueue,dequeue, display, front everything has Time complexity O(1)
